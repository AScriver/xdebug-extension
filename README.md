# ![Xdebug Extension use](src/img/debug32.png) Xdebug Extension

A modern, dependency-free, cross-browser extension for Xdebug.

This work is based on some of the ideas in the legacy [Xdebug helper](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc) extension.

The motivation for this new extension was that `xdebug-helper` will soon no longer be supported and was limited to Chrome in any case. I had originally intended to update and submit a PR on that extension, but realized that it was probably better to just start from scratch using a more modern approach.

## Features

- Set custom IDE key, trace trigger, and profile triggers
